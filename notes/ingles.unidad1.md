These are verbs that can have different uses, meaning and modalities, they can be used to show permission, obligation, possibilities, necessity, ability, advice, willingness, request, probability, etc.

- i **can** knit
- You **cant** go out at night
- Ith **might** show tomorrow (talk about something in a porcentaje of probability)
