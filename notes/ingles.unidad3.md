# Past Habits and Familiarity
## Used to do
- We use this to talk about something that happened in the past but doesnt happen anymore in the present, it is always used in past tense.
- Example:
  - I **used to be** very shy _but_ now I consider myself very outgoing.
  - We **used to hang out** all the time _but_ we dont talk anymore.

## Be used to doing
- We use this to talk about already being familiar with something that we do not even realize. The verb after be used to is alwats an -ing verb.
- Example:
  - I **am used to sleeping** late. I'm night owl
  - She never goes out og he house without a sweater, she **is so used to wearing** it. she'll feel cold.

## Would + verb
- 'Would' is only good for actions or situations that were repeated many times.
- Example:
  - We **would go** back to your house after school, remember?
  - I loved going to my grandma's house, she **'d bake** cookies and we' **'d watch** novelas together.
