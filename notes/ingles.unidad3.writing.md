# Writing (explore new music)

**Music did not always use to be** an important part of my life. When I was a child, between the ages of six and ten, I **did not use to** pay much attention to it. However, in my last year of elementary school, a friend named Dulce gave me a pair of medium-quality headphones. Those headphones stayed with me for almost all of middle school, and thanks to them, I really **got used to** listening to music frequently.

During middle school, I started to develop an interest in rock music. With my headphones and my first phone, I could listen to music non-stop. I **got used to** immersing myself in rock, exploring different bands and styles within the genre.

By the end of middle school, just before entering high school, I went through a transition. My musical tastes changed, and I started to lose interest in rock. That was when I discovered trap music, which quickly became my favorite genre. At first, it was difficult to **get used to** such a different sound, but over time, I **became used to** enjoying it more and more. This change marked the beginning of my journey of musical exploration.

Once I entered high school, my interest expanded beyond just listening to musicâ€”I became fascinated by music production. At first, I found it challenging to **get used to** the complexity of music production, but eventually, I **became used to** experimenting with different sounds and techniques. This curiosity pushed me to explore even more genres. By the middle of high school, during the pandemic, I found myself drawn to a variety of styles, including jazz, alternative rock, hip-hop, reggaeton, and folk music. Each genre introduced me to new sounds and perspectives, deepening my appreciation for music as a whole.

Looking back, my musical journey has been a reflection of my personal growth. I **used to** have no interest in music, but over time, I **got used to** exploring and appreciating different styles. I have realized how powerful and diverse music can be, becoming an essential part of my life, shaping my experiences and emotions in ways I never imagined.
