# Writing (explore new music)

Music was not always an important part of my life. When I was a child, between the ages of six and ten, I did not pay much attention to it. However, in my last year of elementary school, a friend named Dulce gave me a pair of medium-quality headphones. Those headphones stayed with me for most of middle school, and it was through them that I truly fell in love with music. 

During middle school, I started developing an interest in rock and alternative music. With my headphones and my first phone, I could listen to music non-stop. I became deeply immersed in rock, exploring different bands and styles within the genre.

By the end of middle school, right before entering high school, I went through a transition. My taste in music shifted, and I started to lose interest in rock. That was when I discovered trap music, which quickly became my new favorite genre. This change marked the beginning of my journey of musical exploration.

Once I entered high school, my interest expanded beyond just listening to musicâ€”I became fascinated by music production. This curiosity pushed me to explore even more genres. By the middle of high school, during the COVID pandemic, I found myself drawn to a variety of styles, including jazz, gospel, hip-hop, reggaeton, and folk music. Each genre introduced me to new sounds and perspectives, deepening my appreciation for music as a whole.

Looking back, my musical journey has been a reflection of my personal growth. From having no interest in music to constantly exploring and appreciating different styles, I have realized how powerful and diverse music can be. It has become an essential part of my life, shaping my experiences and emotions in ways I never expected.
