# Relative Clauses
## Relative pronouns
- We use **relative pronouns** to introduce relative clauses (ademas est치n en medio de un subject y un verb)
- _Relative clauses_ tell us more about people and things (nos da mas informaci칩n de mas)

### Examples of relative clauses
- This is the house **which** Leonard build last year (de wich al final es una _relative clause_ y la palabra **wich** es un **relative pronoun)**
- I really like the picture **that** is on the fridge

## Table
Pronoun | Use | Example
---|---|---|
who/whom | it is used for people/a person | The man **who** lived next door
which | it is used for things | The door **which** is stuck has a silver knob
that | can be used for both thing and people | The chair **that** was in my room has a broken leg
whose | it is used for show possession | Anne, **whose** mother I know, works here

## Defining and unedifying
- **Defining relative clauses** give essential information about the noun they refer to (nos da informaci칩n esencial). _It doesn't have commas._
- **Unedifying relative clauses** give extra information about the noun they refer to (nos da informaci칩n extra). _It has commas._
